# Dynamic-KPI-Revenue-comparison-
This project is an **interactive Excel dashboard** built using raw quarterly sales and customer data.   It allows stakeholders to monitor revenue, customer growth, and acquisition costs dynamically, with the ability to filter by quarter.  

The dashboard helps in identifying performance trends, comparing against targets, and analyzing key business metrics in real time.

## 🎯 Objective
- To consolidate raw sales and customer acquisition data into a clean, visual dashboard.  
- To provide quick insights into business performance for decision-making.  
- To create a **dynamic reporting system** that updates automatically when new data is added.
